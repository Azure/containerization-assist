        ## Metrics Summary
        - **Interface Count**: $INTERFACE_COUNT (Target: ≤50)
        - **Large Files**: $LARGE_FILES (Target: 0)
        - **Complex Functions**: $COMPLEX_FUNCTIONS (Target: 0)
        - **Build Status**: ✅ Passing
        - **Tests**: ✅ Passing

        ## Quality Standards
        - ✅ Interface count monitoring
        - ✅ File size enforcement (appropriate limits by file type)
        - ✅ Function complexity limits (≤20 with justified exceptions)
        - ✅ Test coverage tracking
        - ✅ Architecture boundary enforcement

        ## Current State
        The codebase currently exceeds some quality thresholds but has monitoring in place.
        This is expected during the refactoring process and will be addressed by other workstreams.

        **Note**: Quality gates are in monitoring mode during refactoring.
