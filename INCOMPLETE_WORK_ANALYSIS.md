## Parallel Implementation Strategy

### Dependency Analysis

After analyzing the codebase dependencies, **most work can be parallelized**. Here's the dependency breakdown:

#### Independent Workstreams (Can run in parallel):
- **Docker Operations** (Pipeline level) - No dependencies
- **Atomic Build Tools** - Only depends on Docker Operations for integration testing
- **Session Tracking** - Independent infrastructure component
- **Context Sharing** - Independent communication layer
- **Security Scanning** - Independent analysis component
- **Workflow Orchestration** - Only depends on other components for integration
- **Interface Architecture** - Can be done incrementally
- **Workspace Sandboxing** - Independent security feature

#### Hard Dependencies:
- Integration testing requires core implementations to be complete
- Some atomic tools need the base `executeWithoutProgress` method
- Context sharing integration requires individual tools to be implemented

The plan prioritizes core functionality first, followed by user experience improvements, and finally advanced features. With proper execution, all TODO items and incomplete implementations can be resolved within 10 weeks, resulting in a robust, feature-complete containerization platform.

The success of this plan depends on:
- Dedicated development resources
- Proper testing infrastructure
- Regular progress reviews and adjustments
- Commitment to code quality standards

By following this plan, Container Kit will evolve from its current state with numerous placeholders and incomplete implementations to a production-ready platform with comprehensive functionality and excellent user experience.
