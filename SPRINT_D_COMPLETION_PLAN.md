# Sprint D-Completion: Test Coverage Achievement Plan

## Overview
**Team:** d  
**Sprint:** D-Completion (High Priority)  
**Focus:** Achieve 80% test coverage target from current 12%  
**Timeline:** High Priority completion before Phase 2 sprints  

## Objectives
- Increase test coverage from current 12% to target 80%
- Implement comprehensive integration tests
- Add missing unit tests for core functionality

## Current Status
- Test coverage: 12.0% (target: 80%)
- Test files: 59 for 268 source files (22% ratio)
- Integration tests: Basic framework exists but limited

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Core Package Test Coverage
- **Target**: ≥80% for `pkg/mcp/internal/*` packages
- **Strategy**: Focus on high-priority modules first
- **Approach**: Identify critical code paths and public APIs

### 2. Table-Driven Tests
- **Target**: All public functions in high-priority modules
- **Pattern**: Use Go's standard table-driven test approach
- **Benefits**: Comprehensive input/output validation

### 3. Integration Test Expansion
- **Current**: Basic framework exists
- **Target**: Real MCP server integration tests
- **Focus**: End-to-end workflow validation

### 4. Mock Implementations
- **Target**: Proper mocking for external dependencies
- **Tools**: Use testify/mock or similar
- **Scope**: Docker API, registry connections, file system operations

### 5. Test CI Enforcement
- **Target**: Coverage reporting and failure on coverage drops
- **Implementation**: Add coverage gates to CI pipeline
- **Monitoring**: Prevent regression below 80% threshold

## Success Criteria
- Core packages achieve ≥80% test coverage
- Comprehensive integration tests for MCP server functionality
- CI enforces coverage requirements
- No flaky tests in the test suite

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
1. Run current test coverage analysis
2. Identify `pkg/mcp/internal/*` packages needing coverage
3. Prioritize based on criticality and complexity

### Phase 2: Unit Test Implementation
1. Start with core packages (lowest coverage, highest impact)
2. Implement table-driven tests for public functions
3. Add missing unit tests for business logic

### Phase 3: Integration Test Enhancement
1. Expand existing integration test framework
2. Add real MCP server integration scenarios
3. Test end-to-end workflows

### Phase 4: Mocking & Dependencies
1. Identify external dependencies needing mocks
2. Implement mock interfaces
3. Replace real dependencies in tests

### Phase 5: CI Integration
1. Configure coverage reporting
2. Set up coverage enforcement gates
3. Add coverage regression prevention

## Files to Modify
- Test files across `pkg/mcp/` packages
- CI configuration for coverage enforcement
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Integration test framework expansion

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Coverage must reach 80% target
- No flaky or unreliable tests
- CI pipeline must enforce coverage requirements

## Post-Implementation Validation
1. Run `go build` - ensure no build errors
2. Run `go vet` - ensure code quality
3. Run `go test` - ensure all tests pass with 80%+ coverage
4. Commit changes when all quality gates pass
