## Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

### High-Risk Items
1. **Scoring System Complexity** - May need additional sprint time
   - Mitigation: Start with simple scoring, iterate
   
2. **Knowledge System Performance** - Could impact tool latency
   - Mitigation: Implement caching early, add feature flags

3. **Breaking Changes** - Pattern migration could break existing code
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, gradual migration

### Contingency Plans
- **If behind schedule:** Focus on P0 items (scoring for 3 key tools)
- **If ahead of schedule:** Add more tools to enhancement list
- **If blocked:** Work on parallel tasks, documentation

3. Are there any blockers?
4. Is the sprint on track?
5. Any discovered work that needs to be added?

### Key Metrics to Track
- Story points completed vs planned
- Test coverage percentage
- Performance benchmark results
- Bug count (should be near zero)
- Documentation completeness
