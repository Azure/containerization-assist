# Team C - Week 3: Standardize All Tools with Unified Patterns

## Current Task: Standardize all tools with unified patterns

### Overview
Ensure all atomic tools follow consistent patterns for interface implementation, error handling, validation, logging, and metadata provision.

### Current State Analysis
Based on the work completed so far:
- ✅ All tools implement unified mcptypes.Tool interface
- ✅ Error handling standardized with types.NewRichError
- ✅ Fixer integration completed for all atomic tools
- ✅ Auto-registration system implemented

### Remaining Standardization Areas

#### 1. Interface Implementation Consistency
- Ensure all tools implement all required interface methods consistently
- Standardize method signatures and return types
- Verify GetMetadata() provides comprehensive information

#### 2. Validation Patterns
- Standardize argument validation approaches
- Ensure consistent use of ValidationErrorBuilder vs NewRichError
- Standardize required field validation

#### 3. Logging Patterns  
- Consistent log levels and messages
- Standardized structured logging fields
- Uniform progress logging patterns

#### 4. Response Structure Patterns
- Consistent result structures across tools
- Standardized success/failure handling
- Uniform duration and timing reporting

#### 5. Documentation and Examples
- Ensure all tools have proper GetMetadata() with examples
- Consistent parameter descriptions
- Standardized capability reporting

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Audit Current Implementation
- Review all atomic tools for interface compliance
- Identify inconsistent patterns
- Document current variations

#### Phase 2: Standardize Validation Patterns
- Ensure consistent validation approaches
- Fix any remaining validation inconsistencies
- Standardize required field checking

#### Phase 3: Standardize Logging and Responses
- Align logging patterns across all tools
- Ensure consistent response structures
- Standardize timing and progress reporting

#### Phase 4: Enhance Metadata and Documentation
- Verify all tools have comprehensive GetMetadata()
- Ensure examples are provided and accurate
- Standardize capability descriptions

#### Phase 5: Final Validation
- Run comprehensive tests
- Verify all patterns are consistent
- Ensure no regressions introduced

### Success Criteria
- All atomic tools follow identical patterns for common operations
- Consistent interface implementations across all tools
- Standardized validation, logging, and error handling
- Comprehensive metadata and documentation
- Clean build and test passes
- All tools ready for production use
