# Workstream 1: Fix Struct Field and Type Compatibility Issues

## Objective
Fix all struct field compatibility issues identified in the pre-commit checks. These issues involve missing fields in various struct types that are expected by test files and implementation code.

## Scope
Focus exclusively on fixing struct field mismatches without changing any other code. The goal is to ensure all structs have the required fields that their consumers expect.

## Affected Files and Issues

### 1. PullImageParams (in pkg/mcp/core/)
**File using it**: `pkg/mcp/internal/pipeline/docker_operations_test.go`
**Missing fields**:
- `ImageRef` (likely string)
- `Platform` (likely string)

### 2. PullImageResult (in pkg/mcp/core/)
**File using it**: `pkg/mcp/internal/pipeline/docker_operations_test.go`
**Missing fields**:
- `PullTime` (likely time.Duration or similar)

### 3. AnalyzeParams (in pkg/mcp/core/)
**File using it**: `pkg/mcp/internal/pipeline/interface_implementations_test.go`
**Missing fields**:
- `RepositoryPath` (likely string)
- `IncludeFiles` (likely []string)
- `ExcludeFiles` (likely []string)
- `DeepAnalysis` (likely bool)

### 4. DeployResult (in pkg/mcp/core/)
**Files using it**: `pkg/mcp/tools/deploy/typesafe_deploy_tool_simple.go`
**Missing fields**:
- `DeploymentTime` (likely time.Time or time.Duration)
- `Data` (likely map[string]interface{})
- `Errors` (likely []string)
- `Warnings` (likely []string)

### 5. HealthCheckResult (in pkg/mcp/core/ or pkg/mcp/tools/deploy/)
**Files using it**: `pkg/mcp/tools/deploy/validate_deployment.go`, `pkg/mcp/tools/deploy/typesafe_deploy_tool_simple.go`
**Missing fields**:
- `Healthy` (bool)
- `Error` (string or error)
- `StatusCode` (int)
- `Checked` (bool)
- `Endpoint` (string)

## Instructions

1. **Locate the struct definitions**: Find where these structs are defined (likely in pkg/mcp/core/ or related packages)

2. **Add missing fields**: Add the missing fields to each struct with appropriate types. Use the context from the test/implementation files to infer the correct types.

3. **Maintain backwards compatibility**: Ensure any existing code using these structs continues to work. Use json/yaml tags if these structs are serialized.

4. **Do not modify test files**: The test files are correct - they expect these fields to exist. Only modify the struct definitions.

5. **Verify compilation**: After adding fields, ensure the affected files compile without errors related to these struct fields.

## Success Criteria
- All struct field errors from the pre-commit output are resolved
- No new compilation errors are introduced
- Existing functionality is preserved
- The changes are minimal and focused only on adding the missing fields

## Example Pattern
```go
// Before
type BuildImageParams struct {
    Dockerfile string
    // other existing fields...
}

// After
type BuildImageParams struct {
    Dockerfile  string
    Tags        []string    // Added based on test expectations
    ContextPath string      // Added based on test expectations
    Pull        bool        // Added based on test expectations
    // other existing fields...
}
```
