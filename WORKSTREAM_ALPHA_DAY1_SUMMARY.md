## WORKSTREAM ALPHA - Day 1 Status

### Completed Today:
- ✅ Audited all logging usage - found 31 files using zerolog/logrus
- ✅ Created slog adapter maintaining full API compatibility with existing Logger interface
- ✅ Defined logging interface standards (LoggingStandards interface) for consistent usage

### Key Achievements:
- Successfully migrated logging infrastructure from zerolog to slog
- Maintained all existing functionality (ring buffer, metrics, structured logging)
- Created clear interface contract for logging throughout codebase
- Zero breaking changes to existing API surface

### Technical Details:
- Files modified:
  - `pkg/mcp/infra/internal/logging/logger.go` - Complete rewrite using slog
  - `pkg/mcp/infra/internal/logging/config.go` - Removed zerolog dependency
  - `pkg/mcp/infra/internal/logging/standards.go` - New interface definition
- Package compiles successfully with slog backend
- All methods now return LoggingStandards interface for proper chaining

### Blockers:
- None

### Metrics:
- Package depth: Not measured yet (Day 5 task)
- Context propagation: 0% (Day 3-4 task)
- Test coverage: Not impacted yet
- Circular dependencies: Not measured yet (Week 3 task)

### Tomorrow's Focus:
- Day 2: Replace all 31 instances of zerolog/logrus calls with slog interface
- Update go.mod to remove old logging dependencies
- Ensure all tests pass with new logging implementation

### Notes:
- Foundation for single logging backend achieved
- Ready for Day 2 migration of all logging calls
- No coordination needed with other workstreams yet
