# Workstream Summary: Parallel Error Resolution

Based on the pre-commit check results, I've identified and categorized the remaining compilation errors into 5 parallel workstreams that can be worked on independently.

## Workstream Status

### âœ… Workstream 1: Struct Field Compatibility Issues (COMPLETED)
**File**: `WORKSTREAM_1_STRUCT_FIELDS_PROMPT.md`
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** 
**Scope**: Fixed missing struct fields that tests and implementation code expected
**Issues Resolved**: All struct field compatibility issues have been fixed

---

## Remaining Workstreams (Can be done in parallel)

### ðŸ”§ Workstream 2: Undefined Types and Missing Type Definitions
**File**: `WORKSTREAM_2_UNDEFINED_TYPES_PROMPT.md`
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Scope**: Create missing type definitions and fix undefined type references

**Key Issues**:
- Missing types: `ResourceLimits`, `ResourceSpec`, `HealthCheckConfig`, `GenerateDockerfileResult`
- Missing fields in existing structs: `ManifestCount`, `Wait`, `Timeout`
- Missing functions in scan tools package
- Type reference issues in dockerfile validation

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

---

### ðŸ”„ Workstream 3: Method Signature and Interface Compatibility
**File**: `WORKSTREAM_3_METHOD_INTERFACE_PROMPT.md`  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium-High (3-4 hours)
**Scope**: Fix method signatures, interface implementations, and type compatibility

**Key Issues**:
- Context interface mismatches (gomcp.Context vs context.Context)
- Logger type mismatches (slog.Logger vs zerolog.Logger)  
- Local vs core struct type alignment
- Type assertion and usage issues

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

---

### ðŸ“¦ Workstream 4: Import Cycles and Package Dependencies
**File**: `WORKSTREAM_4_IMPORT_CYCLES_PROMPT.md`
**Estimated Effort**: High (4-5 hours)
**Scope**: Resolve import cycles and package dependency issues

**Key Issues**:
- Server â†’ Tools â†’ Core â†’ Server import cycles
- Tools cross-dependencies
- Missing import statements
- Package structure issues

**Dependencies**: May benefit from completing Workstream 2 first (type definitions)

---

### ðŸ§ª Workstream 5: Test Implementation Issues
**File**: `WORKSTREAM_5_TEST_FIXES_PROMPT.md`
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Scope**: Fix test-specific compilation and implementation issues

**Key Issues**:
- Missing test helper functions
- Test logic issues (incorrect assertions)
- Missing mock implementations
- Test configuration issues

**Dependencies**: May require some types from Workstream 2

---

## Recommended Parallelization Strategy

### Phase 1 (Can start immediately, no dependencies)
- **Workstream 2**: Undefined Types âš¡ START FIRST
- **Workstream 3**: Method/Interface Issues âš¡ START FIRST

### Phase 2 (Start after Phase 1 progress)
- **Workstream 4**: Import Cycles (benefits from Workstream 2 types)
- **Workstream 5**: Test Fixes (benefits from Workstream 2 types)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All compilation errors resolved
- [ ] `make pre-commit` passes without build errors
- [ ] `make test` runs without compilation failures
- [ ] No new import cycles introduced
- [ ] All tests can execute (even if they fail, they should compile and run)

## Coordination Notes

1. **Workstream 2** should be prioritized as it provides type definitions needed by other workstreams
2. **Workstream 3** can run completely in parallel with others
3. **Workstream 4** may need to coordinate with others if it involves moving types between packages
4. **Workstream 5** is mostly self-contained but may need types from Workstream 2

Each workstream includes detailed instructions, examples, and success criteria in its respective prompt file.
