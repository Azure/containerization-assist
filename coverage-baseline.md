| `pkg/pipeline/repoanalysisstage` | 56.5% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |
| `pkg/mcp/utils` | 55.3% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |

### Core MCP Packages - Priority Targets üö®

| `pkg/mcp/internal/orchestration` | 6.1% | 73.9% | **HIGH** |

### Packages with NO Tests üö®
The following core packages have 0% coverage, indicating missing test files:
- `pkg/mcp/internal/registry` - Registry management (Sprint D priority)
- `pkg/mcp/internal/scan` - Security scanning (Sprint D priority)
- `pkg/mcp/internal/conversation` - Conversation handling
- `pkg/mcp/internal/workflow` - Workflow orchestration
- `pkg/mcp/internal/server` - MCP server implementation
- `pkg/ai` - AI integration
- `pkg/clients` - Client implementations
- `pkg/logger` - Logging utilities

### Supporting Infrastructure Packages
| Package | Coverage | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `pkg/mcp/internal/transport` | 39.2% | Good foundation |
| `pkg/mcp/internal/pipeline` | 43.1% | Good foundation |
| `pkg/mcp/internal/utils` | 43.6% | Good foundation |
| `pkg/mcp/internal/observability` | 33.4% | Needs improvement |
| `pkg/mcp/internal/types` | 29.0% | Basic coverage |

## Action Plan Priority

### Phase 1: Zero to Basic Coverage (Days 1-3)
Focus on packages with 0% coverage to establish basic test infrastructure:
1. `pkg/mcp/internal/registry` - Essential for container operations
2. `pkg/mcp/internal/scan` - Critical for security scanning
3. `pkg/mcp/internal/conversation` - Core MCP functionality
4. `pkg/mcp/internal/server` - MCP server implementation

### Phase 2: Core Package Enhancement (Days 4-7)
Bring critical packages from low coverage to 80%:
1. `pkg/mcp/internal/build` (7.8% ‚Üí 80%)
2. `pkg/mcp/internal/deploy` (6.6% ‚Üí 80%)
3. `pkg/mcp/internal/orchestration` (6.1% ‚Üí 80%)
4. `pkg/mcp/internal/analyze` (10.4% ‚Üí 80%)

### Phase 3: Foundation Strengthening (Days 8-10)
Enhance supporting packages:
1. `pkg/mcp/internal/core` (16.6% ‚Üí 80%)
2. `pkg/mcp/internal/runtime/conversation` (17.2% ‚Üí 80%)
3. `pkg/mcp/internal/transport` (39.2% ‚Üí 80%)
4. `pkg/mcp/internal/utils` (43.6% ‚Üí 80%)

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### High-Priority Test Areas
1. **Error Handling**: All packages show low coverage, likely missing error path tests
2. **Business Logic**: Core orchestration and workflow logic needs comprehensive testing
3. **Integration Points**: MCP protocol, Docker, Kubernetes, registry interactions
4. **Security Scanning**: Critical for Sprint B coordination

### Mock Requirements
- Docker client operations
- Kubernetes API calls
- Container registry APIs
- File system operations
- Network calls

### Test Infrastructure Needs
- Table-driven test patterns for consistency
- Mock frameworks for external dependencies
- Integration test harness for MCP protocol
- Coverage reporting and enforcement in CI

## Files for Investigation
Key files that likely need tests based on Sprint D requirements:
- `pkg/mcp/internal/build/build_image_atomic.go` (Sprint A coordination)
- `pkg/mcp/internal/deploy/deploy_kubernetes.go` (Sprint A coordination)
- `pkg/mcp/internal/registry/multi_registry_manager.go` (Sprint B coordination)
- `test/integration/integration_test.go` (needs replacement)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 4 packages with 0% coverage ‚Üí basic test coverage (‚â•20%)
- [ ] 4 core packages reach 80% coverage target
- [ ] Integration test replacement completed
- [ ] CI coverage enforcement active
- [ ] No flaky or failing tests

**Next Steps:** Begin orphaned test file analysis and start implementing tests for zero-coverage packages.
