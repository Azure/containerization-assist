ðŸŸ¡ MONITORING: Integration test suite has 1 failure (TestMCPWorkflowIntegrationSuite)
ðŸ”´ FAILING: push_image and scan_image_security tools fail to register

WORKSTREAM VALIDATION
--------------------
Workstream A (Interfaces): MONITORING
- Build status: PASS
- Test impact: 2 Tool interfaces found (target: 1)
- Performance: Baseline established

Workstream B (Adapters): MONITORING
- Build status: PASS
- Test impact: 12 adapter files found (target: 0)
- Performance: Baseline established

Workstream C (Legacy): COMPLETE
- Build status: PASS
- Test impact: 0 legacy patterns found (target: 0)
- Performance: N/A - already clean

INTEGRATION STATUS
-----------------
Overall health: ISSUES
Cross-workstream conflicts: Tool registration issues found

QUALITY METRICS
--------------
Test pass rate: 98% (MCP tests pass, 1 integration test failure)
Performance vs baseline: N/A (baseline established today)
Coverage: Not measured yet

MERGE RECOMMENDATION
-------------------
Workstream A: NOT READY - Interface consolidation needed
Workstream B: NOT READY - Adapter elimination needed
Workstream C: READY - No legacy code found

Critical issues requiring attention:
- push_image tool fails to register (auto_registration.go line 24)
- scan_image_security tool missing Validate method (fixed by another agent)
- Integration test failure needs investigation

Files modified (test updates):
