WORKSTREAM C - DAY 1 SUMMARY
============================
Progress: 50% complete (Day 1 of 2)
Migration systems removed: ✅
Legacy methods removed: ✅
Fallbacks evaluated: ✅

Files modified:
- pkg/mcp/internal/state/integration.go (removed migration registration and MigrateAllStates)
- pkg/mcp/internal/state/unified_state_manager.go (removed StateMigrator interface and MigrateState)
- pkg/mcp/internal/config/manager_test.go (removed TestMigrationHelper)
- pkg/mcp/internal/transport/stdio.go (removed fallback mechanisms)
- pkg/mcp/internal/build/strategies.go (removed legacy build strategy fallback)
- pkg/mcp/internal/analyze/analyzer.go (added stub functions for compatibility)

Files deleted:
- pkg/mcp/internal/state/migrators.go (complete migration system)
- pkg/mcp/internal/config/migration.go (configuration migration system)
- pkg/mcp/internal/analyze/analyzer_config.go (deprecated analyzer config)

Legacy methods removed from atomic tools:
- pkg/mcp/internal/build/build_image_atomic.go (GetName, GetDescription, GetVersion, GetCapabilities)
- pkg/mcp/internal/build/pull_image_atomic.go (same methods)
- pkg/mcp/internal/build/tag_image_atomic.go (same methods)

Issues encountered:
- Some legacy types (WorkflowSession, WorkflowStage, etc.) are still actively used
- Some deprecated methods (ShouldRetry, GetBackoff) are still referenced
- Migration helper methods in errors.go are still in use

Tomorrow's focus:
- Continue removing remaining legacy code patterns
- Focus on deprecated methods that can be safely removed
- Clean up remaining legacy comments and documentation
- Final validation and testing
