MERGE RECOMMENDATION
-------------------
Workstream A: READY - Interface consolidation complete
Workstream B: NOT READY - Adapter elimination in progress (8 files remain)
Workstream C: READY - No legacy code

Critical issues requiring attention:
- None - all issues from Day 1 resolved

Files modified (test updates):
- pkg/mcp/internal/analyze/additional_coverage_test.go - Fixed AnalyzerConfig references
- pkg/mcp/internal/analyze/analyzer_simple_test.go - Updated to use new config fields
- pkg/mcp/internal/analyze/analyzer_test.go - Commented out LoadFromEnv test (needs rewrite)
- pkg/mcp/internal/orchestration/types_test.go - Fixed Parameters type (map[string]string)
- pkg/mcp/internal/core/tool_middleware_test.go - Removed (orphaned test file)
- pkg/mcp/internal/server/unified_server_test.go - Fixed Parameters type

Tomorrow's focus:
- Continue monitoring Workstream B adapter elimination
- Run performance benchmarks to compare with baseline
- Monitor any new changes from workstreams
- Validate complete integration after adapter elimination
