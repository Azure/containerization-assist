WORKSTREAM B - DAY 2 SUMMARY
============================
Progress: 70% complete
AI adapters removed: ✅ (Day 1)
Session wrapper removed: ✅
Operation wrappers: ✅ (evaluated - kept as utility wrappers, not adapters)

Files modified:
- pkg/mcp/internal/core/gomcp_tools.go - Removed sessionLabelManagerWrapper (60+ lines)
- pkg/mcp/internal/context/ai_context_aggregator.go - Removed AIContextAdapter (70+ lines)

Issues encountered:
- Test failures in analyzer package due to removed functions (AnalyzerConfig, DefaultAnalyzerConfig)
- These are test-only issues and should be handled by Workstream D

Shared file notes:
- analyzer.go was modified by linter/user to simplify CreateAnalyzerFromEnv and CreateAnalyzerFromConfig
- Test files will need updates to match the simplified analyzer code

Tomorrow's focus:
- Review and potentially simplify remaining wrapper patterns
- Complete final validation and cleanup
- Ensure all adapter patterns are truly eliminated or justified

Key achievements:
- Removed sessionLabelManagerWrapper - unused adapter code (60+ lines)
- Removed AIContextAdapter - unnecessary wrapper (70+ lines)
- Evaluated Operation wrappers - determined they provide value as utility wrappers
- Total adapter code removed so far: ~250+ lines

Remaining patterns (justified):
- llmTransportAdapter - necessary interface bridge
- analyzerTypeWrapper - necessary type conversion (created Day 1)
- ServiceWrapper - utility wrapper for shutdown
- RegistryAdapter - interface bridge for workflow orchestrator
