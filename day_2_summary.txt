WORKSTREAM C - DAY 2 SUMMARY
============================
Progress: 100% complete (Day 2 of 2)
Migration systems removed: ✅ (Day 1)
Legacy methods removed: ✅
Fallbacks evaluated: ✅

Day 2 Files modified:
- pkg/mcp/internal/runtime/conversation/retry_manager.go (removed deprecated ShouldRetry and GetBackoff methods)

Day 2 Analysis completed:
- Identified that WorkflowSession/WorkflowStage type aliases are still actively used (268 occurrences)
- Confirmed deprecated syntax checking is legitimate validation (not legacy code)
- Verified remaining "legacy" references are legitimate uses:
  - ExecuteTyped methods provide type safety
  - SendPrompt mock implementation is still needed
  - GetTool interface method is actively used
  - "legacyClients" variable name is misleading but code is current

Issues NOT addressed (still in use):
- Legacy workflow type aliases in execution_types.go (used in 268 places)
- Migration helper methods in errors.go (still referenced)
- ExecuteTyped backward compatibility methods (provide needed functionality)
- Legacy interface methods that are part of public APIs

Legacy code patterns reduced:
- Day 1: From ~220 to ~88 occurrences  
- Day 2: From ~88 to ~79 occurrences

Summary of 2-day effort:
- Deleted 3 complete files (migrators.go, migration.go, analyzer_config.go)
- Removed legacy SimpleTool methods from 3 atomic tool files
- Removed fallback mechanisms from transport and strategies
- Removed deprecated methods from retry_manager.go
- Total lines removed: ~700+

Remaining legacy patterns (79) are mostly:
- Comments documenting backward compatibility decisions
- Active compatibility layers still in use
- Legitimate validation of deprecated external patterns
- Test mock implementations

COMPLETE - Ready for external merge
