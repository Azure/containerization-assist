MERGE RECOMMENDATION
-------------------
Workstream A: READY - Complete and tested
Workstream B: NOT READY - 7 adapter files remain
Workstream C: READY - Complete and tested

Critical issues requiring attention:
- Integration test failure (pre-existing, not caused by changes)
- 7 adapter files still need elimination

Files modified (test updates):
- None today (all test fixes completed on Day 2)

Tomorrow's focus:
- Continue monitoring adapter elimination progress
- Investigate integration test failure if time permits
- Final validation when adapter elimination complete
- Prepare final handoff documentation
