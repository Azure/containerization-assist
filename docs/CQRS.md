# Understanding CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**CQRS Definition:** Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that separates operations that mutate state (commands) from those that read state (queries). In essence, instead of using a single unified model for all actions, CQRS has a distinct *write model* for commands and a separate *read model* for queries. This segregation means a command *changes* the system (and typically does **not** return data, just a success/failure status), whereas a query *returns* data but does **not** modify anything. By isolating reads from writes, systems can achieve improved performance, scalability, and maintainability in complex domains.

**Benefits of CQRS:** Adopting CQRS provides several advantages:

- **Independent Scaling:** Read and write workloads can be scaled independently. For example, if reads vastly outnumber writes, you can scale out the query side without affecting the command side. This minimizes lock contention and improves performance under load.  
- **Optimized Data Models:** Each side can use its own data schema optimized for its purpose. The write model can focus on enforcing business rules and consistency, while the read model can shape data into efficient query results (e.g. pre-joined or denormalized views) without complex transformations.  
- **Clearer Separation of Concerns:** CQRS enforces a clear boundary between business logic that handles **commands** (state changes) and logic that handles **queries** (data retrieval). This often leads to more maintainable code, since each part has a single responsibility.  
- **Improved Security and Permissions:** You can apply different authorization rules to commands vs. queries. For instance, only certain roles may execute state-changing commands, whereas many roles can read data. Separating the pathways makes such policies easier to manage.  
- **Simpler Query Interfaces:** Because the read side can be tailored to retrieval only, it can return exactly the data needed by clients without dragging in domain complexities. This can eliminate the need for repetitive mapping from domain objects to view models in read operations.  

**Typical Use Cases:** CQRS is especially useful in **collaborative or high-scale systems** where conflicts are frequent or read/write loads are very different. Scenarios include:

- **High-Read/Write Disparity:** Applications with far more reads than writes (e.g. reporting dashboards, social media feeds) benefit by scaling query handlers and databases separately.  
- **Complex Domains with Rich Business Logic:** Where write operations involve complex validations or workflows (common in domain-driven design), isolating that complexity in command handlers keeps the query side simple.  
- **Multi-User Collaborative Systems:** CQRS helps avoid merge conflicts by designing fine-grained commands and handling concurrency via events or versioning.  
- **Event Sourcing and Temporal Workflows:** Systems that leverage events (audit logs, temporal queries) often use CQRS so that the event log updates happen on the write side, while the read side builds projections for querying. (Event sourcing is not required for CQRS, but they complement each other well.)

## CQRS vs. Traditional Layered Architecture vs. Event Sourcing

**Compared to Traditional Layered Architecture:**  
In a traditional n-tier architecture (presentation → business logic → data layer), the same domain models and pipelines handle both reads and writes. This unified approach is straightforward but can lead to:

- **Unified Model Complexity:** A single model must satisfy both update operations and query requirements, often leading to compromises and extra mapping code.  
- **Redundant Processing:** Read-only operations may pass through write-focused layers, adding unnecessary overhead.  
- **Readability:** Service classes can become bloated with both state-changing methods and data-returning methods. CQRS separates these concerns explicitly.  
- **Level of Optimization:** CQRS allows independent performance tuning for reads and writes, which is harder under a unified model.

For simple applications, a well-structured layered architecture may suffice. CQRS shines when complexity and scale demand specialized approaches.

**Compared to Event Sourcing:**  
Event sourcing is about storing state changes as a sequence of events rather than persisting the current state directly.

- **Different Concerns:** CQRS splits read/write models; event sourcing defines how state is persisted. You can use one without the other.  
- **Complexity:** Event sourcing requires event log management and projection building. CQRS alone is a smaller leap from traditional architectures.  
- **Using Together:** They complement each other well — events can feed read-model projections, providing auditability and optimized queries.  
- **Eventually Consistent Reads:** Writes update the read side asynchronously, so queries may momentarily lag. This trade-off must be managed in design and UX.

## CQRS in the Go Codebase (`pkg/mcp` Module)

The **Container Kit MCP** server code uses a CQRS-style structure in `pkg/mcp`, particularly in the `application` layer:

### Commands (`pkg/mcp/application/commands/`)

- **Command Interface & Types:**  
  ```go
  type Command interface {
      CommandID() string
      CommandType() string
      Validate() error
  }
  ```
  Concrete commands (e.g. `ContainerizeCommand`, `CancelWorkflowCommand`) embed common fields and implement `Validate()` to enforce domain rules.

- **Command Handlers:**  
  ```go
  type CommandHandler interface {
      Handle(ctx context.Context, cmd Command) error
  }
  ```
  Each handler:  
  1. Casts and validates the `Command`.  
  2. Delegates to domain services (e.g. workflow orchestrator).  
  3. Updates application state via a `sessionManager`.  
  4. Optionally publishes events.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Command handlers change state but don’t return data. For cancellation, the handler marks a session “cancelled,” and the workflow checks that status to stop itself.

### Queries (`pkg/mcp/application/queries/`)

- **Query Interface & Types:**  
  ```go
  type Query interface {
      QueryID() string
      QueryType() string
      Validate() error
  }
  ```
  Queries like `WorkflowStatusQuery`, `SessionListQuery` carry parameters and validate them.

- **Query Handlers:**  
  ```go
  type QueryHandler interface {
      Handle(ctx context.Context, query Query) (interface{}, error)
  }
  ```
  Each handler:  
  1. Validates the `Query`.  
  2. Reads state via services (e.g. `sessionManager.Get` or `List`).  
  3. Constructs and returns a view model (DTO) with only needed fields.  
  4. Performs **no** state mutations.

- **Maintaining Separation:**  
  Query code focuses solely on data retrieval and shaping outputs, never invoking domain workflows or updates.

## Performance and Testing Implications

**Performance & Scalability:**

- **Independent Scaling:** Read and write services can be deployed and scaled separately. For heavy query loads, add query replicas or caches; for writes, isolate transactional resources.  
- **Optimized Read Models:** The read side can use in-memory caches or precomputed views without impacting write logic.  
- **Reduced Contention:** Command processing doesn’t block or slow down read operations.

**Testing & Maintainability:**

- **Unit Testing Commands:**  
  Use mocks for orchestrators and session managers to verify side-effects without running actual workflows.  
- **Unit Testing Queries:**  
  Stub data sources and assert on returned DTOs. Since no state changes occur, tests remain pure and side-effect free.  
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Test command flows and query flows independently, making it easier to localize and fix faults.

This clear separation enhances code readability, team onboarding, and long-term maintainability by ensuring each feature’s read and write logic is isolated and testable.
