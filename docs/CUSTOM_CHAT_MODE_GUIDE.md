## Troubleshooting

### Chat Mode Not Appearing

1. **Check File Location**
   ```bash
   ls -la .github/chatmodes/
   # Should show: container-kit.chatmode.md
   ```

2. **Verify File Format**
   - Ensure the file has proper YAML front-matter
   - Check that the description field is properly quoted
   - Validate the tools array syntax

3. **Restart VS Code**
   ```bash
   # Close VS Code completely, then reopen
   code .
   ```

4. **Check VS Code Settings**
   - Open Settings (`‚åò ,` or `Ctrl + ,`)
   - Search for: `chat.modeFilesLocations`
   - Ensure it includes `.github/chatmodes` (default)

### Chat Mode Active But Not Working

1. **Verify Chat Mode Selection**
   - Look for "Container Kit Development Assistant" in the dropdown
   - The description should mention "AI-powered containerization assistant"

2. **Test with Simple Query**
   ```
   What are the 10 steps in Container Kit's containerize_and_deploy workflow?
   ```

3. **Check Copilot Status**
   - Ensure GitHub Copilot is signed in and active
   - Verify you have chat access (not just code completion)

### Performance Issues

1. **Large Codebase**
   - The Container Kit codebase is substantial (~150+ files)
   - Initial queries may take longer as the AI analyzes the code
   - Subsequent queries should be faster

2. **Optimize Queries**
   - Be specific about which files or directories you're working with
   - Reference specific architectural layers to narrow scope

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Architecture
Always begin conversations by establishing the architectural context:

```
I'm working on the Infrastructure layer, specifically with Docker integration. 
How do I...
```

### 2. Use Container Kit Terminology
Leverage the domain-specific language:

- "workflow steps" instead of "functions"
- "progress tracking" instead of "status updates"  
- "AI retry logic" instead of "error handling"
- "Rich error system" instead of "exceptions"
- "domain events" instead of "notifications"
- "command handlers" instead of "controllers"
- "saga orchestration" instead of "transaction management"
- "ML optimization" instead of "performance tuning"

### 3. Reference Documentation
The chat mode is aware of Container Kit's extensive documentation:

```
According to ADR-006 (Four-Layer MCP Architecture), how should I implement 
this new feature in the 4-layer architecture?
```

### 4. Think in Workflows
Frame questions around the 10-step containerization process:

```
How do I add custom validation between the Scan step (9) and Finalize step (10)?
```

### 5. Security First
Always consider security implications:

```
What security scanning patterns should I follow when adding this new 
container registry integration?
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

- **Architecture decisions** - "Should this be in Domain or Infrastructure layer?"
- **Code reviews** - "Does this follow Container Kit patterns?"
- **Debugging** - "Why is the workflow session not persisting?"
- **Testing strategies** - "How do I test this MCP integration?"

### Feature Development
Leverage for:
- **Planning** - "How do I add support for Podman alongside Docker?"
- **Implementation** - "What's the pattern for adding AI analysis to this step?"
- **Integration** - "How do I ensure this works with existing error recovery?"
- **Documentation** - "What ADR should I write for this change?"
