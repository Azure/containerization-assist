# ADR-000: Architecture Decision Records

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team
**Context:** Need for documenting architectural decisions and their rationale

## Decision

We will document all significant architectural decisions using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) stored in the `docs/adr/` directory.

## Rationale

As the containerization-assist MCP server has evolved, we've made several significant architectural decisions (Result<T> pattern, unified tool interface, knowledge enhancement system, policy-based configuration, etc.). These decisions need to be:

1. **Documented**: Future contributors need to understand why decisions were made
2. **Traceable**: Link decisions to the problems they solve
3. **Reviewable**: Allow team members to discuss and validate architectural choices
4. **Historical**: Preserve context even as team members change

ADRs provide a lightweight, version-controlled way to capture this information alongside the code.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Knowledge Retention**: Architectural context preserved in version control
- **Onboarding**: New contributors can understand key decisions quickly
- **Decision Quality**: Writing forces critical thinking about alternatives
- **Change Management**: Easier to understand impact of changing decisions
- **Team Alignment**: Shared understanding of architectural principles
- **Audit Trail**: Clear history of when and why decisions were made

### Negative

- **Maintenance Overhead**: ADRs need to be written for significant decisions
- **Potential Staleness**: ADRs could become outdated if not maintained
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to adopt ADR practice
- **Discipline Required**: Requires consistent application across the project

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Wiki/Confluence Documentation

- **Pros:**
  - Rich formatting and collaboration features
  - Easy to search and navigate
  - Familiar to many teams
- **Cons:**
  - Separate from codebase, can become stale
  - Not version controlled with code
  - Requires separate tooling and access
- **Rejected because:** We want architectural docs version-controlled alongside code

### Alternative 2: Code Comments Only

- **Pros:**
  - Located exactly where decisions are implemented
  - No separate documentation to maintain
  - Always visible to developers reading code
- **Cons:**
  - Difficult to get high-level architectural overview
  - Comments can become outdated
  - No structure for comparing alternatives
  - Hard to find all architectural decisions
- **Rejected because:** Need structured, discoverable documentation of rationale and alternatives

### Alternative 3: Verbal/Tribal Knowledge

- **Pros:**
  - No documentation overhead
  - Fast decision-making
  - Flexible communication
- **Cons:**
  - Knowledge lost when team members leave
  - New contributors struggle to understand decisions
  - No record of alternatives considered
  - Leads to repeated discussions
- **Rejected because:** Not sustainable for long-term project maintenance

## ADR Format

All ADRs in this project follow this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated | Superseded
**Deciders:** [Names or "Development Team"]
**Context:** [Why we needed to make this decision]

## Decision

[What we decided to do - clear, concise statement]

## Rationale

[Why we made this decision - the reasoning and principles]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

### Negative
- [Cost 1]
- [Cost 2]

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- **Pros:** [List]
- **Cons:** [List]
- **Rejected because:** [Reason]

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Architecture Patterns**: Error handling, dependency injection, module organization
- **Technology Choices**: Frameworks, libraries, protocols, tools
- **Data Models**: Core domain models, API contracts, storage schemas
- **Quality Attributes**: Performance, security, scalability approaches
- **Development Practices**: Testing strategies, deployment processes, code standards

**Don't write ADRs for:**
- Implementation details that don't affect architecture
- Temporary workarounds or experiments
- Standard best practices (unless deviating from them)

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: New ADR under discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision no longer recommended but still in use
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR (link to new ADR)
