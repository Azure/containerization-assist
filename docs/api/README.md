# Container Kit API Documentation

⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: This directory has been consolidated into the unified API reference.

## New Location

The API documentation has been moved to:
**[docs/reference/api/interfaces.md](../reference/api/interfaces.md)**

## What Changed

This consolidation addresses several issues with the previous documentation:

- **Outdated Information**: Multiple files contained outdated interface definitions
- **Redundant Content**: Duplicate information across files
- **Inconsistent Structure**: Different formatting and organization
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Multiple files to keep in sync

## Migration

The new consolidated documentation includes:

- ✅ **Current Interface Definitions** - Sourced from actual code
- ✅ **Complete Tool System** - All tool interfaces and examples
- ✅ **Pipeline System** - Complete pipeline documentation
- ✅ **Registry System** - Tool registration and management
- ✅ **Workflow System** - Multi-step workflow orchestration
- ✅ **Validation System** - Domain-specific validation
- ✅ **Build System** - Container build operations
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Unified error system
- ✅ **Monitoring** - Metrics and observability
