# ADR-011: Decorator Pattern for Workflow Orchestration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Container Kit workflow system supports multiple cross-cutting concerns through a composable architecture:

1. **Event Publishing**: Workflows publish domain events for observability
2. **Saga Coordination**: Long-running workflows use distributed transaction support
3. **Metrics Collection**: Performance monitoring tracks all workflow operations
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates support long-running operations
5. **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry mechanisms implement exponential backoff
6. **Tracing**: Distributed tracing enables debugging and performance analysis

The architecture avoids large monolithic orchestrator classes by using decorator composition to maintain single responsibility and testability.

## Decision
The system implements a **Decorator Pattern** for workflow orchestration that composes cross-cutting concerns:

### Core Design

1. **Base Orchestrator**: Minimal implementation focused on core workflow logic
2. **Decorator Functions**: Wrap orchestrators with additional capabilities
3. **Composition**: Stack decorators to build full-featured orchestrators

### Architecture Overview
```go
// Base interface
type WorkflowOrchestrator interface {
    ExecuteWorkflow(ctx context.Context, args Args) (*Result, error)
}

// Decorator functions
func WithEvents(base WorkflowOrchestrator, publisher events.Publisher) EventAwareOrchestrator
func WithSaga(base EventAwareOrchestrator, coordinator *saga.Coordinator) SagaAwareOrchestrator
func WithMetrics(base WorkflowOrchestrator, collector metrics.Collector) WorkflowOrchestrator
func WithProgress(base WorkflowOrchestrator, factory progress.Factory) WorkflowOrchestrator
func WithRetry(base WorkflowOrchestrator, policy retry.Policy) WorkflowOrchestrator
func WithTracing(base WorkflowOrchestrator, tracer trace.Tracer) WorkflowOrchestrator
```

### Decorator Implementation
```go
type eventAwareOrchestrator struct {
    base      WorkflowOrchestrator
    publisher events.Publisher
}

func (e *eventAwareOrchestrator) ExecuteWorkflow(ctx context.Context, args Args) (*Result, error) {
    // Publish workflow started event
    e.publisher.Publish(ctx, events.WorkflowStarted{Args: args})
    
    // Execute base workflow
    result, err := e.base.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, args)
    
    // Publish completion event
    if err != nil {
        e.publisher.Publish(ctx, events.WorkflowFailed{Args: args, Error: err})
    } else {
        e.publisher.Publish(ctx, events.WorkflowCompleted{Args: args, Result: result})
    }
    
    return result, err
}
```

### Composition in Dependency Injection
```go
func ProvideWorkflowDeps(
    orchestrator workflow.WorkflowOrchestrator,
    eventPublisher events.Publisher,
    sagaCoordinator *saga.SagaCoordinator,
    logger *slog.Logger,
) WorkflowDeps {
    // Compose decorators
    eventAware := workflow.WithEvents(orchestrator, eventPublisher)
    sagaAware := workflow.WithSaga(eventAware, sagaCoordinator, logger)
    
    return WorkflowDeps{
        EventAwareOrchestrator: eventAware,
        SagaAwareOrchestrator:  sagaAware,
    }
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Single Responsibility**: Each decorator has one focused concern
- **Composable**: Can mix and match decorators as needed
- **Testable**: Each decorator can be tested independently
- **Flexible**: Easy to add new decorators without modifying existing code
- **Clean**: No complex inheritance hierarchies
- **Type Safe**: Compile-time guarantees about decorator combinations

### Negative
- **Indirection**: Multiple layers of delegation can make debugging harder
- **Memory Overhead**: Each decorator adds a small memory overhead
- **Complexity**: Need to understand decorator composition order

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal Runtime Overhead**: Simple delegation with minimal processing
- **Memory**: ~64 bytes per decorator instance
- **Latency**: <1μs additional latency per decorator layer

## Implementation Details

### Available Decorators

1. **Event Decorator** (`WithEvents`)
   - Publishes domain events at workflow boundaries
   - Enables event-driven architecture patterns
   - Supports observability and auditing

2. **Saga Decorator** (`WithSaga`) 
   - Coordinates distributed transactions
   - Handles compensation logic for failures
   - Ensures eventual consistency

3. **Metrics Decorator** (`WithMetrics`)
   - Collects performance metrics
   - Tracks success/failure rates
   - Measures execution duration

4. **Progress Decorator** (`WithProgress`)
   - Emits real-time progress updates
   - Supports long-running workflow UX
   - Integrates with MCP progress protocol

5. **Retry Decorator** (`WithRetry`)
   - Implements intelligent retry logic
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Progressive error context integration

6. **Tracing Decorator** (`WithTracing`)
   - Distributed tracing spans
   - Request correlation across services
   - Performance debugging support

### Decorator Order Considerations
The order of decorator application matters:

```go
// Correct order: Tracing -> Metrics -> Retry -> Events -> Saga -> Base
tracer := WithTracing(base, tracer)
metrics := WithMetrics(tracer, collector)
retry := WithRetry(metrics, retryPolicy)
events := WithEvents(retry, publisher)
saga := WithSaga(events, coordinator)
```

**Rationale**:
- Tracing should wrap everything for complete span coverage
- Metrics should capture retry attempts
- Events should fire after retries complete
- Saga should coordinate the final successful execution

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Each decorator is tested independently:
```go
func TestEventDecorator(t *testing.T) {
    mockBase := &MockOrchestrator{}
    mockPublisher := &MockPublisher{}
    
    decorated := WithEvents(mockBase, mockPublisher)
    
    result, err := decorated.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, args)
    
    // Verify base was called
    assert.Equal(t, 1, mockBase.CallCount())
    
    // Verify events were published
    assert.Equal(t, 2, mockPublisher.EventCount()) // start + complete
}
```

### Integration Testing
Full decorator stack testing:
```go
func TestFullDecoratorStack(t *testing.T) {
    // Build full stack
    orchestrator := buildFullOrchestrator()
    
    result, err := orchestrator.ExecuteWorkflow(ctx, args)
    
    // Verify all decorators participated
    assertEventsPublished(t)
    assertMetricsCollected(t)
    assertTracingSpansCreated(t)
}
```

## Alternative Patterns Considered

1. **Aspect-Oriented Programming**: Too complex for Go ecosystem
2. **Middleware Pattern**: Provides similar functionality but with less type safety than decorators
3. **Monolithic Orchestrator**: Violates single responsibility principle
4. **Inheritance**: Go favors composition over inheritance

## Compliance
This ADR implements:
- **Decorator Pattern**: Classic GoF design pattern
- **Single Responsibility**: Each decorator has one concern
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension via new decorators, closed for modification
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Uses composition to build complex behavior
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean interfaces for each decorator capability
