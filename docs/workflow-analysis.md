# Container Kit Workflow Analysis: Annotated Process Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a detailed analysis of the Container Kit's `containerize_and_deploy` workflow execution, highlighting the advanced sampling patterns, saga pattern implementation, and AI-powered retry mechanisms.

## Workflow Execution Timeline

### 1. Workflow Initialization (17:19:37.408)
```
Starting containerize_and_deploy workflow
workflow_id=workflow-java-servlet-hello-1752527978
repo_url=https://github.com/GRomR1/java-servlet-hello
steps_count=10
```

**Code Reference**: `pkg/mcp/domain/workflow/containerize_workflow.go`
- The workflow orchestrator initializes with a unique workflow ID
- Implements the 10-step containerization process as defined in the architecture

### 2. Repository Analysis Phase (Step 1/10)

#### Git Clone with Retry Logic
```
Attempting git clone branch=main attempt=1
Git clone attempt failed branch=main error="exit status 128"
Attempting git clone branch=master attempt=2
Git clone completed successfully branch=master
```

**Code Reference**: `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/orchestration/steps/analyze_repository.go`
- Implements intelligent branch detection (tries 'main' then 'master')
- Shows resilient error handling at the infrastructure layer

#### Repository Analysis
```
Detected Java servlet application (found web.xml)
language=java framework=maven-servlet dependencies=2
```

**Code Reference**: `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/orchestration/steps/repository_analyzer.go`
- Technology detection based on file patterns
- Attempts AI enhancement but falls back gracefully when template not found

### 3. Dockerfile Generation (Step 2/10)
```
Generating Dockerfile
base_image=openjdk:17-jdk-slim lines=27 port=0
```

**Code Reference**: `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/orchestration/steps/generate_dockerfile.go`
- Uses template-based Dockerfile generation
- Note: Port 0 issue that will cause problems later

### 4. AI-Powered Build Optimization (Step 3/10)

#### Resource Prediction with Advanced Sampling
```
Predicting build resources
component=resource_predictor
Resource prediction completed cpu_cores=2 memory_mb=2048 confidence=0.92
```

**Advanced Sampling Pattern Implementation**:
1. **First Sampling Call** (17:19:41.905 - 17:19:42.542):
   - Uses MCP sampling client at `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/ai_ml/sampling/mcp_client.go`
   - Temperature: 0.3 (low for consistent predictions)
   - Confidence: 0.92

2. **Second Sampling Call** (17:19:46.036 - 17:19:46.402):
   - Refined prediction with confidence: 0.95
   - Shows iterative improvement pattern

**Code References**:
- `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/orchestration/steps/build_image_optimized.go`
- `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/ai_ml/ml/resource_predictor.go`
- `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/ai_ml/sampling/sampling_client.go:74-78` (MCP sampling implementation)

#### Optimized Build Command Generation
```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --cpuset-cpus 0-1 --memory 2048m 
--cache-to type=local,dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache 
--mount type=cache,target=/root/.m2,id=maven-repo,sharing=shared
```

**Optimization Features**:
- CPU limitation (2 cores)
- Memory constraints (2048MB)
- Build cache mounting for Maven dependencies
- Platform-specific build (linux/amd64)

### 5. Docker Build Execution
```
Docker build completed successfully
duration=5.220802584s
predicted_time=2m0s actual_time=5.220969532s
optimization_accurate=true
```

**Note**: The actual build was much faster than predicted (5s vs 2m), showing conservative estimation.

### 6. Security Scan Failure (Step 4/10)
```
ERROR msg="Security scan failed" 
error="INTERNAL_ERROR: no vulnerability scanners available. Install Trivy or Grype"
WARN msg="Continuing workflow despite scan failure"
```

**Code Reference**: `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/orchestration/steps/security_scan.go`
- Shows graceful degradation when optional components are missing
- Workflow continues despite non-critical failures

### 7. Kubernetes Deployment with Saga Pattern (Steps 8-9/10)

#### Initial Deployment Attempt
```
Deployment validation failed: 0/0 pods ready
Port: 0
```

#### Saga Pattern and AI-Powered Recovery

**First Retry with LLM Analysis**:
```
Starting operation with LLM-guided retry
operation=validate_kubernetes_deployment max_retries=3
```

**LLM Error Analysis** (17:20:12.983):
```
root_cause="The deployment validation failed because 0/0 pods are ready. 
This typically means that no pods were created for the deployment. 
The most likely cause is that the container port is set to 0"
can_auto_fix=true fix_steps=1
```

**Code References**:
- `pkg/mcp/domain/saga/saga_coordinator.go` - Saga pattern coordination
- `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/ai_ml/sampling/llm_guided_retry.go` - AI-powered retry logic
- `pkg/mcp/domain/workflow/error_context.go` - Progressive error context

**Second Retry - Node NotReady Issue**:
```
ERROR: 0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had untolerated taint {node.kubernetes.io/not-ready: }
LLM Error Analysis:
root_cause="The Kubernetes node being in a NotReady state"
can_auto_fix=true fix_steps=8
```

**Saga Pattern Implementation Details**:
1. **Error Context Accumulation**: Each failure adds to the progressive error context
2. **AI-Guided Compensation**: LLM suggests 8 fix steps for node issues
3. **Automatic Retry**: System waits (2s delay) and retries
4. **State Management**: Maintains consistency across retry attempts

### 8. Successful Deployment (Retry 2)
```
Deployment validation successful pods_ready=1 pods_total=1
Step succeeded after retry attempts=2
```

The saga pattern successfully recovered from:
1. Invalid port configuration (Port: 0)
2. Temporary node scheduling issues
3. Image pull timing issues

### 9. Health Verification (Step 10/10)
```
Deployment verification completed
deployment_ok=true pods_ready=1 pods_total=1
Failed to get service endpoint (non-critical)
```

**Note**: Service endpoint retrieval failed because only deployment was created (no service manifest).

## Advanced Patterns Analysis

### 1. Advanced Sampling Pattern
The system uses a sophisticated sampling approach with:

- **Template-based Prompting**: Uses embedded templates at `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/ai_ml/prompts/`
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Leverages Model Context Protocol for sampling
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each AI prediction includes confidence metrics
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple sampling calls for improved accuracy

**Key Implementation**: `pkg/mcp/infrastructure/ai_ml/sampling/sampling_client.go`
```go
// MCP sampling request pattern
msg="Using MCP sampling with server"
prompt_length=566 max_tokens=1000 temperature=0.30000001192092896
```

### 2. Saga Pattern Implementation
The workflow implements a distributed saga pattern for:

- **Compensation Logic**: AI-suggested fixes act as compensation actions
- **State Consistency**: Maintains workflow state across retries
- **Progressive Error Context**: Accumulates error history for better recovery
- **Idempotent Operations**: Deployments can be safely retried

**Key Components**:
- `pkg/mcp/domain/saga/` - Core saga interfaces
- `pkg/mcp/application/workflow/saga_orchestrator.go` - Saga coordination
- `pkg/mcp/domain/workflow/error_context.go` - Error accumulation

### 3. Retry Strategies
The system employs multiple retry strategies:

1. **Simple Retry**: Git clone branch detection (main → master)
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Deployment validation waits (1s → 2s → 4s)
3. **AI-Guided Retry**: LLM analyzes failures and suggests fixes
4. **Limited Retries**: Max 3 attempts with escalation

## Performance Metrics

- **Total Workflow Duration**: 46.73s
- **Docker Build**: 5.22s (optimized with buildx)
- **Resource Prediction Latency**: ~4-5s per LLM call
- **Deployment Recovery**: ~24s (including 3 validation attempts)

## Key Observations

1. **Resilient Design**: The workflow recovered from multiple failures automatically
2. **AI Integration**: LLM sampling provides intelligent error analysis and fixes
3. **Performance**: Sub-minute deployment despite multiple retries
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Missing security scanners don't block workflow
5. **Port Configuration Issue**: The system detected and worked around the Port:0 issue

## Architecture Insights

The logs demonstrate the 4-layer architecture in action:
- **Domain Layer**: Workflow orchestration, saga coordination
- **Application Layer**: MCP protocol handling, session management  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker/K8s operations, AI/ML services
- **API Layer**: Clean interfaces between layers

The advanced sampling and saga patterns work together to create a self-healing, intelligent containerization workflow that can recover from common deployment issues without human intervention.
