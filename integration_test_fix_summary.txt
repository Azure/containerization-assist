INTEGRATION TEST FIX SUMMARY
============================

ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
- Integration tests failing with "exec: StdinPipe after process started" error
- Root cause: Test was calling StdinPipe() after starting the process

FIXES APPLIED:
1. **Process Pipe Management Fix**:
   - Created MCPServerInstance struct to hold cmd and pipes
   - Modified startMCPServer() to get all pipes (stdin, stdout, stderr) BEFORE starting process
   - Updated executeWorkflowSteps() and other functions to use pre-created pipes

2. **Tool Name Corrections**:
   - Fixed tool names from "atomic_analyze_repository" to "analyze_repository"
   - Fixed "atomic_validate_dockerfile" to "validate_dockerfile"
   - Fixed "atomic_generate_manifests" to "generate_manifests"

3. **Tool Arguments Enhancement**:
   - Added missing required fields for analyze_repository tool:
     - branch: "main"
     - language_hint: repo.Language
     - shallow: true
   - Updated repo_url format to use "file://" prefix

4. **Git Repository Setup**:
   - Added proper git repository initialization for test repos
   - Configured git user and disabled commit signing for tests
   - Added initial commit to create proper git history

RESULTS:
✅ Fixed the main "StdinPipe after process started" error
✅ Process starts correctly and pipes work
✅ MCP server initializes successfully in tests
✅ Tool communication layer is functional

REMAINING ISSUES:
- Some tools still have validation/execution issues (separate from pipe problem)
- These are tool-specific implementation issues, not test infrastructure problems

The critical test infrastructure problem has been resolved. The integration tests now properly:
1. Start the MCP server process
2. Establish communication pipes correctly
3. Send and receive MCP protocol messages
4. Handle tool execution requests

This fix resolves the systematic test failure and enables proper integration testing going forward.
