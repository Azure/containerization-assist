  ```go
  // Replace this pattern:
  func (b *BaseInjectableClients) GetDockerClient() docker.DockerClient {
      if b.clientFactory == nil {
          panic("client factory not injected")
      }
      return b.clientFactory.CreateDockerClient()
  }
  
  // With this:
  func (b *BaseInjectableClients) GetDockerClient() (docker.DockerClient, error) {
      if b.clientFactory == nil {
          return nil, fmt.Errorf("client factory not injected - call SetClientFactory first")
      }
      return b.clientFactory.CreateDockerClient(), nil
  }
  ```
- **Replace panic() with error returns** in `pkg/mcp/internal/config/global.go:57`

## **🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - Structural Issues**

### 4. Fix Directory Structure
- **Move** `pkg/mcp/cmd/mcp-server/` to repository root `cmd/mcp-server/`
  - Binary entry point inside package directory violates Go package conventions
  - Command binaries typically belong in `cmd/` at repository root
- **Consolidate duplicate interface definitions**
  - Root: `pkg/mcp/interfaces.go`
  - Core: `pkg/mcp/core/interfaces.go` 
  - Types: `pkg/mcp/types/` validation interfaces
  - Potential interface duplication and confusion

### 5. Fix Naming Inconsistencies
- **Rename files with `llm_llm_` prefix** to remove duplication:
  - `llm_llm_stdio.go`
  - `llm_llm_http.go` 
  - `llm_llm_mock.go`
- **Fix repeated prefixes**:
  - `pipeline_pipeline_test_helpers.go`
  - `profiling_profiling_test_suite.go`
- **Standardize 24 files with duplicate names** across packages:
  - `analyzer.go` (multiple packages)
  - `common.go` (multiple packages)
  - `types.go` (9+ packages)
  - `validator.go` (multiple packages)

### 6. Remove Legacy Compatibility Code
- **Remove** `legacyClients` variable in `pkg/mcp/internal/core/gomcp_tools.go:226`
- **Remove** backward compatibility methods in `pkg/mcp/internal/orchestration/tool_orchestrator.go:165,184`
  - "The following methods maintain backward compatibility but delegate to the new implementation"
  - "This method is kept for backward compatibility"
- **Remove** legacy type aliases in `pkg/mcp/internal/orchestration/execution_types.go:66`
  ```go
  // Legacy workflow types for backward compatibility
  type WorkflowSession = ExecutionSession
  type WorkflowStage = ExecutionStage
  type WorkflowStatus = string
  ```
- **Remove** legacy data conversion functions in `pkg/mcp/internal/session/state.go:377,443`
  - `ConvertRepositoryInfoToScanSummary`
  - `ConvertScanSummaryToRepositoryInfo`

## **🟠 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Over-Engineering**

### 7. Simplify Over-Complex Files (Est. 50% size reduction)
- **Refactor** `build_fixer.go` (1,634 lines) → target ~400 lines
  - Contains 15+ different struct types for error handling
  - Complex analysis types like `BuildFailureAnalysis`, `BuildFixerPerformanceAnalysis`
  - Over-engineered error categorization with 5+ levels of classification
- **Refactor** `performance_optimizer.go` (1,179 lines) → target ~300 lines
  - Complex performance optimization system with 7 different manager/analyzer dependencies
  - Over-complex metrics tracking with nested structs for simple performance counters

  - Complex ML pipeline with model registry, feature extraction, training engines
  - Replace with simple configuration-based optimization

### 8. Reduce Interface Complexity
- **Consolidate** 19 interfaces in `pkg/mcp/core/interfaces.go` (626 lines) to 3-5 core interfaces
  - Complex nested structures like `SessionState` (38+ fields), `ServerConfig` (43+ fields)
  - Over-abstracted types like `ToolMetadata`, `ProgressReporter`, `SecurityScanResult`
  - Many interfaces with only 1-3 methods that could be simple function types
- **Remove unnecessary factory patterns** where simple constructors would work
- **Simplify complex structs** with 40+ fields:
  - `ResourceMonitor` struct (150+ lines of type definitions, 44 fields)
  - Break down into smaller, focused types

### 9. Split Large Packages
- **Consider splitting** `internal/build/` (66 files) into focused sub-packages
- **Break down** monolithic files >500 lines
- **Review** package organization for single responsibility

## **🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Code Quality**

### 10. Replace Non-Idiomatic Go Patterns
- **Replace 289 instances of `interface{}`** with specific types
  - Example in `pkg/mcp/internal/scan/scan_image_security_atomic.go:26,27,46`
  ```go
  type AtomicScanImageSecurityTool struct {
      pipelineAdapter interface{}  // Should be specific interface
      sessionManager  interface{}  // Should be specific interface
  }
  ```
- **Define constants for magic numbers** in `pkg/mcp/mcp.go:29-54`
  ```go
  MaxSessions:       100,        // Magic number
  MaxDiskPerSession: 1 << 30,    // Magic number (1GB)
  TotalDiskLimit:    10 << 30,   // Magic number (10GB)
  MaxBodyLogSize:    1 << 20,    // Magic number (1MB)
  MaxWorkers:        10,         // Magic number
  ```
- **Remove unnecessary getter/setter methods** (337 files affected)
  - Use direct field access where appropriate
  - Eliminate verbose accessor patterns

### 11. Complete Stubs and TODOs
- **Implement TODOs** in `pkg/mcp/internal/observability/preflight_checker.go`
- **Complete stubs** in `pkg/mcp/internal/session/resource_monitor.go`
- **Finish implementations** in `pkg/mcp/internal/utils/sandbox_executor.go`  
- **Address 39 files with TODO/FIXME comments** indicating incomplete implementations

### 12. Standardize Error Handling
- **Implement consistent error patterns** across all packages
- **Add proper context propagation**
- **Standardize error wrapping**
- **Remove inconsistent error handling** (mix of panic(), returned errors, no handling)

## **📊 ESTIMATED IMPACT**

## **🔍 ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY**

This cleanup analysis was conducted through:
- Comprehensive directory structure mapping (446 Go files, 117 test files)
- Dead code detection via import analysis and usage patterns
- Complexity analysis of large files (>500 lines) and deep abstractions
- Legacy pattern detection via keyword and comment analysis  
- Go idiom compliance checking against best practices
- Cross-reference validation for orphaned code

## **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES**

- **Test thoroughly** after each phase - especially panic() → error conversions
- **Coordinate** structural changes with team to avoid merge conflicts
- **Preserve** existing functionality while simplifying implementation
- **Document** any breaking API changes from panic() removal
- **Validate** that removed code is truly unused before deletion

## **🤖 AI ANALYSIS PROMPT**

To repeat this analysis after cleanup implementation, use this prompt with an AI assistant:

```
Please analyze the pkg/mcp portion of this codebase for cleanup opportunities. Focus on:

1. **Dead Code Detection**:
   - Unused functions, structs, interfaces, and variables
   - Functions/methods that are never called
   - Orphaned test files and mock implementations
   - Files importing packages that don't exist or aren't used

2. **Over-Engineering Analysis**:
   - Files >500 lines that could be simplified
   - Complex abstractions where simple solutions would work
   - Excessive interface usage (>5 interfaces per file)
   - Factory patterns that just wrap simple constructors
   - Enterprise patterns (saga, circuit breaker) for simple operations

3. **Structural Issues**:
   - Files with repeated prefixes (e.g., `prefix_prefix_file.go`)
   - Binary commands inside package directories
   - Duplicate interface definitions across packages
   - Mixed concerns in single directories

4. **Legacy Code Patterns**:
   - Search for: "legacy", "backward", "deprecated", "TODO", "FIXME"
   - Compatibility shims and adapters
   - Type aliases for backward compatibility
   - Fallback mechanisms for older systems

5. **Non-Idiomatic Go**:
   - Excessive use of `interface{}` instead of specific types
   - `panic()` usage in library code
   - Magic numbers without constants
   - Unnecessary getter/setter methods
   - Complex type assertions without proper error handling

**Output Format**:
- Provide specific file paths and line numbers
- Estimate lines of code that can be removed
- Prioritize by impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Include code examples for complex issues
- Suggest refactoring strategies for over-engineered components

**Analysis Methodology**:
1. Use directory structure mapping to understand layout
2. Search for patterns using grep/search tools
3. Identify files with high complexity (line count, cyclomatic complexity)
4. Cross-reference imports and usage to find dead code
5. Look for naming patterns that indicate structural issues

Focus particularly on the `pkg/mcp/internal/` directory structure and any files >1000 lines.
