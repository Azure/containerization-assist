# Orphaned Test Files Resolution

## Investigation Summary

### Test Files Mentioned in Plan
1. **auto_advance_test.go** - ✅ Not orphaned, has implementation, tests pass
2. **no_external_ai_test.go** - ✅ Intentionally orphaned policy compliance test

### Additional Investigation Results

#### Removed Orphaned Test Files
The following test files were removed because they reference non-existent types and functions:
1. `pkg/mcp/internal/analyze/repository_test.go` - Referenced undefined: NewCloner, CloneOptions, NewAnalyzer, AnalysisOptions, NewContextGenerator, AnalysisContext
2. `pkg/mcp/internal/build/build_image_atomic_validate_test.go` - Referenced undefined: NewAtomicBuildImageTool, AtomicBuildImageArgs

#### Verified Working Test Files
The following test files were verified to have corresponding implementations:
- `pkg/mcp/internal/core/tool_argument_mapping_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/analyze/analyze_error_handling_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/customizer/k8s_customizer_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/deploy/manifests_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/observability/profiling_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/orchestration/orchestration_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/runtime/conversation/preflight_autorun_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/runtime/conversation/prompt_manager_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/runtime/conversation/welcome_stage_simple_test.go`
- `pkg/mcp/internal/types/types_test.go`

## Actions Taken
1. Investigated 34 potentially orphaned test files
2. Identified 2 truly orphaned test files with non-existent implementations
3. Removed the 2 orphaned test files:
   - `repository_test.go` 
   - `build_image_atomic_validate_test.go`

## Result
- Reduced orphaned test count from 34 to 32
- All remaining "orphaned" test files are either:
  - Integration/E2E tests
  - Policy compliance tests
  - Benchmark tests
  - Tests with renamed/refactored implementations that still work
