  Analyze these container security scan results and suggest remediations:

  Security Scan Results:
  {{.ScanResults}}

  Current Dockerfile:
  {{.DockerfileContent}}

  Critical Issues Only: {{.CriticalOnly}}

  Please provide:
  1. Summary of the most critical vulnerabilities
  2. Specific Dockerfile changes to remediate vulnerabilities
  3. Alternative base images if current one has too many vulnerabilities
  4. Best practices to improve container security

  Focus on practical remediations that can be implemented in the Dockerfile.
  If base image has critical vulnerabilities, suggest newer/more secure alternatives.

  Return your analysis in a clear, actionable format.
