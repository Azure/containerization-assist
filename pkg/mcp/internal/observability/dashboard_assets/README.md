# Dashboard Assets

This directory contains static assets for the enhanced dashboard.

In a production implementation, this would include:
- CSS files for styling
- JavaScript libraries and custom scripts
- Icon fonts and images
- Chart.js or D3.js visualizations
- WebSocket client implementation

For the demo, assets are embedded in the main dashboard HTML.
