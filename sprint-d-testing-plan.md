# Sprint D: Testing & Quality Foundation - Implementation Plan

## Overview
**Team:** D
**Duration:** Week 1-2
**Focus:** Achieve comprehensive test coverage and eliminate test debt
**Target:** ≥80% test coverage on core packages

## Objectives
- Achieve ≥80% test coverage on core packages
- Eliminate orphaned test files and implement missing tests
- Add real integration tests

## Phase 1: Assessment & Baseline (Days 1-2)

### 1.1 Coverage Baseline Report
- Run `go test -cover ./...` to establish current coverage
- Generate detailed coverage report using `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out`
- Identify packages below 80% coverage threshold
- Document findings in coverage-baseline.md

### 1.2 Orphaned Test Analysis
- Scan `pkg/mcp` for orphaned test files (tests with no corresponding implementation)
- Catalog 26+ orphaned test files mentioned in plan
- Classify each file: delete, implement, or relocate
- Document findings in orphaned-tests-analysis.md

### 1.3 Integration Test Assessment
- Review `test/integration/integration_test.go:18`
- Identify gaps in MCP server integration testing
- Plan replacement with real integration tests

## Phase 2: Core Coverage Implementation (Days 3-7)

### 2.1 High-Priority Public Functions
- Identify exported functions in core packages without tests
- Implement table-driven tests for:
  - `pkg/mcp/internal/build/` - build orchestration functions
  - `pkg/mcp/internal/deploy/` - deployment functions
  - `pkg/mcp/internal/registry/` - registry management
  - `pkg/mcp/internal/scan/` - security scanning
- Focus on business logic and error paths

### 2.2 Error Handling & Boundary Conditions
- Add tests for all error return paths
- Test boundary conditions (empty inputs, nil pointers, etc.)
- Validate timeout and cancellation behavior
- Test resource cleanup and error recovery

### 2.3 Mock Integration Points
- Create mocks for external dependencies (Docker, Kubernetes, registries)
- Test tool orchestration without external services
- Validate MCP protocol message handling

## Phase 3: Integration Testing (Days 8-10)

### 3.1 Real MCP Server Tests
- Replace stub integration test at `test/integration/integration_test.go:18`
- Implement end-to-end MCP server testing
- Test tool registration and discovery
- Validate request/response message flow
- Test error propagation between tools

### 3.2 Tool Chain Integration
- Test build → push → deploy workflow
- Test failure scenarios and error escalation
- Validate context sharing between tools
- Test automatic iterative fixing scenarios

## Phase 4: CI Integration & Enforcement (Days 11-14)

### 4.1 Coverage Enforcement
- Add coverage check to CI pipeline
- Configure minimum 80% coverage requirement
- Set up coverage reporting and badges
- Implement coverage regression detection

### 4.2 Test Quality Gates
- Ensure all new exported functions include tests
- Add linting for missing test files
- Configure parallel test execution
- Set up test result reporting

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Core packages ≥80% coverage
- [ ] No CI-failing tests due to flakiness
- [ ] All new exported functions include tests
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end MCP functionality
- [ ] All orphaned test files resolved (deleted, implemented, or relocated)
- [ ] Coverage enforcement active in CI

## Risk Mitigation
- **Flaky Tests:** Use deterministic mocks and avoid time-dependent assertions
- **External Dependencies:** Mock all external services and APIs
- **Performance:** Run tests in parallel where possible
- **Maintenance:** Keep tests simple and focused on single responsibilities

## Dependencies
- None (Sprint D can run in parallel with other sprints)
- Coordination with Sprint A for testing automatic fixing features
- Input from other sprints for newly implemented functionality

## Deliverables
1. Coverage baseline report with current state analysis
2. Orphaned test files resolution plan and implementation
3. Table-driven tests for all high-priority public functions
4. Real MCP server integration tests replacing stub implementation
5. Comprehensive error handling and boundary condition tests
6. CI pipeline with coverage enforcement ≥80%
7. Test quality gates and regression detection
