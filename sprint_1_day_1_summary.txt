INFRABOT - SPRINT 1 DAY 1 SUMMARY
====================================
Mission Progress: 100% complete
Today's Deliverables: ✅ All Docker operations implemented ✅ Session tracking schema complete

Files Modified:
- pkg/mcp/internal/pipeline/operations.go: Implemented Docker pull, push, and tag operations with proper error handling, timeouts, and session integration
- pkg/mcp/internal/session/session_manager.go: Enhanced session tracking with job tracking, tool tracking, and error counting infrastructure

Dependencies Delivered:
- Complete Docker operations (pull/push/tag) ready for BuildSecBot integration
- Session tracking infrastructure available for all teams
- Atomic tool framework foundation established

Dependencies Needed:
- None - InfraBot provides foundation layer

Blockers & Issues:
- No current blockers
- All implementations tested and verified

Tomorrow's Priority:
- Monitor BuildSecBot integration with Docker operations
- Provide support for session management needs
- Begin advanced session persistence features if needed

Quality Status:
- Tests: ✅ make test-mcp passing (all session and pipeline tests pass)
- Build: ✅ go build succeeding
- Lint: ✅ golangci-lint clean

Merge Readiness: READY

Technical Implementation Details:
=================================

Docker Operations (pkg/mcp/internal/pipeline/operations.go):
- PullDockerImage: Full implementation with 10-minute timeout, error handling, and session updates
- PushDockerImage: Full implementation with 15-minute timeout, comprehensive logging
- TagDockerImage: Full implementation with 2-minute timeout, efficient execution
- All operations include proper validation, context handling, and session integration

Session Tracking Schema (pkg/mcp/internal/session/session_manager.go):
- Added job tracking: AddJob(), RemoveJob() methods for active job management
- Added tool tracking: AddCompletedTool() method for completed tool history
- Added error tracking: RecordError(), getTotalErrorCount(), getLastError() methods
- Enhanced SessionManagerStats with actual error counting
- Fixed all TODO items related to session tracking implementation
- Maintained thread safety with proper mutex usage

Performance & Reliability:
- All Docker operations have appropriate timeouts (2-15 minutes based on operation complexity)
- Session tracking uses efficient in-memory data structures with BoltDB persistence
- Error handling includes detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Thread-safe implementation suitable for concurrent access

Integration Points for Other Teams:
- BuildSecBot can now use all Docker operations via the Operations interface
- OrchBot can leverage session tracking for workflow coordination
- AdvancedBot can monitor session statistics and error tracking
- All teams can use the enhanced session management features

Sprint 1 Day 1 Success Criteria Met:
✅ All 3 Docker operations implemented (pull/push/tag)
✅ Session tracking database schema complete
✅ Base atomic tool framework available for BuildSecBot
✅ Zero test failures
✅ Clean linting status
✅ Production-ready error handling and logging

Next Steps for BuildSecBot Integration:
- Docker operations are fully functional and ready for atomic tool integration
- Session tracking provides the foundation for coordinating multi-tool workflows
- Error tracking enables proper failure handling and retry logic
- All operations follow the established patterns for consistency
