# Team C - Fixer Module Integration Plan

## Issue
According to REORG.md, the fixer module integration is non-functional, specifically mentioning a StubAnalyzer issue.

## Investigation Plan
1. Search for StubAnalyzer references in the codebase
2. Find tools that should implement SetAnalyzer
3. Check if fixer integration is properly implemented
4. Fix any missing or broken implementations

## Expected Outcome
- All tools that need fixing capabilities properly implement SetAnalyzer
- Fixer module integration works correctly
- Tools can automatically fix issues they detect
